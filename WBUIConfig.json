Every challenge you overcome, every quest you complete, and every tier you ascend in the Aetheric Spire rewards you with meaningful power and efficiency.\r\n\r\nOur unique systems ensure that your character grows stronger not just through levels, but through your actions, as well as making sure you have plenty of rewards to chase after. Your XP, harvesting, and taming improve over time, while your combat abilities evolve alongside you and your tames. The world around you is balanced to respect your time, rewarding dedication without forcing endless or enabling extremely boosted rates from the start.\r\n\r\n\r\n<TextStyle.Green>Using the Server Guide</>\r\n\r\nThis Server Guide is your quick-reference hub for all essential gameplay information. Whether you need details on progression, rates/stats, details of ongoing events, or even just the latest Server Update Notes, you'll find them here.\r\n\r\nFor additional help, updates, and community discussions, be sure to use the Discord button to join our server.

						"title": "Latest Update",
						"text": "**__3/15/2025__**\r\n**Fixes**\r\n-Fixed an issue with multiple custom damage configurations not applying properly.\r\n-Fixed an issue with damage tuning that allowed players to damage Mechanical Apostles without the proper means (separate from the above fix. I borked multiple things in that config)\r\n-Fixed supply crates not spawning at all if there happened to be a structure in its way. Supply drops will now simply deploy on top of a structure if they collide with one.\r\n-Fixed an extra damage multiplier being applied to tames while harvesting, causing a lag spike. This also caused an unintended increase in general farming speed. So while you might farm a bit slower with tames, you'll still get the same amount of resources. \r\n-Fixed a database issue preventing Level Up Events from granting rewards.\r\n\r\n**Quests**\r\n-Removed the Dino Mania Compound Bow crafting requirement from \"Not Great for Rear of Ogres\". Quest now requires crafting 50 of the 1K Dino Mania arrows instead.\r\n-Enabled access to Weekly and Daily Quests.\r\n   -Access is granted upon completing certain main quests.\r\n   -Access to a tier's Weekly and Daily quests is removed upon progressing to the next tier.\r\n   -Players can acquire Reset tokens that can be used to reset your current Daily or Weekly quest (complete or incomplete) for a new one. These can be earned as rewards, purchased from the ARKShop, and earned from VIP loot crates.\r\n-Enabled an automatic reset timer for Daily and Weekly Quests. This is unfortunately just a little clunky on initial access, as your quest timers won't reflect properly until the first reset.\r\n   -Daily quests reset at 5AM EST.\r\n   -Weekly quests reset on Monday at 5AM EST.\r\n-Cleaned up the UI message, and added new relevant info.\r\n-Added a requirement for crafting Quantum Knight armor to the final quest for Castaway.\r\n-Renamed Cerberus Challenges to Aetheric Spire Challenges.\r\n   -Cerberus Challenges as a name will be repurposed for something else for PvPvE ;)\r\n\r\n**Scorched Earth: DOX Server**\r\nNew Overhaul server has been added with a familiar name: Utopia Ablaze! Due to the highly custom nature of the mod's gameplay loop, this will be a very lightweight server in regards to customization compared to the main cluster. \r\n-Overhaul: DOX2. https://www.curseforge.com/ark-survival-ascended/mods/dino-ovherhaul-x-2\r\n   \"DOX2 offers many tiers of evolution and custom armors (similar to ARPGs) with stat rolls and set bonuses for melee, damage reduction, stamina increase, health regen, and more. The mod includes dozens of custom items to aid progression, adding abilities to your dinos like AOE group mechanics and evolution items. New structures allow for boss summoning, crafting, mining forge which makes resource gathering less primitive in the late game.\"\r\n-Server is configured with the \"Easy\" difficulty.\r\n-Player food and water drain reduced by 15%\r\n-All rates are vanilla\r\nCurrent mod list:\r\n   -DOX2\r\n   -Inventory Saver\r\n   -Mouse Saver\r\n   -Nanoh's Spyglass\r\n   -Nanoh's Reusables\r\n   -Nanoh's Ascended Equipment\r\n   -Omega Teleporter\r\n   -Dino Depot\r\n   -Shiny Dinos\r\n   -ASR\r\n   -B+ Structures\r\n   -Admin Panel\r\n   -HUD Stuff Durability\r\n   -Mantling\r\n   -Player Traits\r\n   -World Builder\r\n   -Cerberus Additions\r\n   -Imbue Station\r\n\r\n\r\n**Svartalfheim**\r\nNew premium map has been added: Svartalfheim! \r\n__Server Name__: Runeheim\r\n-Flyers are completely disabled.\r\n-Prototherians and Unproven have been re-classified for Svart.\r\n   -Prototherian-class creatures are named Frumkyn.\r\n   -Unproven will be a special case where it's only one particular creature, and they will be known as Grimforged.\r\n-Dwarf damage resistance and damage dealt increased by 50%.\r\n-Thurduar's Bane damage resistance increased by 20% per tier. Damage dealt has been increased by 12.5%\r\nComing Soon:\r\n-Quest chains that will be available to Svart owners.\r\n-Unique Boss Events.\r\n-Nexus Incursions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**General Game Changes**\r\n-Added an in-game server guide (WIP). This can be accessed with F1 on a keyboard, or through your radial menu on controller.\r\n\t-This can provide information on the latest server update notes, current events, as well as guides and tips for different features of the cluster and mods.\r\n   -Information can be edited cluster-wide from anywhere, allowing for new information to always be available through the guide :) I'll try to make all announcements both here and Discord.\r\n-Increased base global weight reduction from 15% to 40%\r\n-Enabled same-map downloading for items. This means that if, for whatever reason you need to, you can use /download on the same map where you uploaded your items. \r\n-Slightly increased the gain to weight stats when progressing to the next Tier.\r\n-Increased weight reduction to 50% for multiple resources.\r\n-Disabled the Pegomastax pet from dropping. If you wanna be sneaky sneaky, you'll have to invest a bit more into it :P\r\n-Attempting a spawn override to replace S-Deinons with Bright Raptors due to multiple issues with S-Deinons (THIS BETTER WORK FFS)\r\n-Increased the fuel consumption interval by 225% to assist with charcoal production. \r\n-Charcoal crafting cost for Reinforced Ingots has been reduced from 3 to 1.\r\n-Cost of Quality Scrap has been reduced to 50 Reinforced Ingots.\r\n-Disabled Titanosaur feeding. This was a setting leftover from when this was all originally for a private server.\r\n-Increased Honey stacksize to 20.\r\n-Added crafting cost of 25 Magic Essence to the Awesome Teleporter Remote.\r\n-Spoil time multiplier has been reduced from 5x to 2.5x\r\n-Opened up Tough and Strong Dino Mania spawns on The Island.\r\n-Cleaned up a lot of old config code\r\n-Removed Meganeura from potential Shiny spawns.\r\n-Added Dreadmare and Pyromane spawns to Extinction.\r\n-Removed Spawn Blocker mod.\r\n-Added a new Dino Population Control mod. I don't like to constantly run full-map dino wipes, but there are still times where it's good to have at least some management on a daily basis. This will be utilized for a few different things:\r\n\t-Biome-specific dino wipes and population control\r\n\t-Class-specific dino wipes to address potential overspawns across the map.\r\n\t-Torpor-based wipe protection to ensure wild dinos with a certain % of torpor will not be wiped.\r\n   -Buff-based blacklisting to prevent certain buffed creatures (Like Shinies) from being wiped.\r\n\t-Automatic wiping of unclaimed dinos after 15 minutes.\r\n-Reduced the max amount of dropped items in a given area of the world from 600 to 500.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Creature Trait Changes**\r\nThe following Traits have had their chances of being on a wild creature adjusted by the following amounts:\r\n-Healer increased by 10%\r\n-Horde Fighter reduced by 25%\r\n-Forager increased by 15%\r\n-Wraithborne increased by 10%\r\n-Hangry increased by 10%\r\n-Hivemind reduced by 35%\r\n-Fearmonger increased by 15%\r\n-Razorback reduced by 20%\r\n-Radiated reduced by 40%\r\n\r\n\r\n**Event Bosses and Minions**\r\n-Replaced Pteranodon minions with Yi Lings.\r\n-Replaced Cerato minions with S-Thylacos.\r\n-Added Tough Mantises to the Bane of Nanoh minions.\r\n-Added Bright Arthros to Wrath of Littlefoot minions.\r\n-Reduced size scaling for Bane of Nanoh boss due to an animation issue. \r\n-Added Rubber Troll event.\r\n   -Level 450\r\n   -4.5million health\r\n   -Melee increased by 35%\r\n   -Rubber Shiny effect\r\n   -Minions consist of Orcs, Werewolves, and Praetorian Mega Spiders.\r\n      -Level range: 375-450\r\n      -Possible Shiny buffs: Burning, and Psychotropic.\r\n   -Damage resistance values for wild Trolls apply to boss trolls.
